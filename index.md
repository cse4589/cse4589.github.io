# Introduction
This is a set of _three_ **networking programming assignments** (PAs), along with an automated tester/grader, available to both students and instructors. The assignments have been used in CSE 489/589, a joint senior undergraduate/introductory graduate class, in the [CSE department](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html){:target="_blank"} at the [University at Buffalo (UB)](http://www.buffalo.edu/){:target="_blank"}. For each PA, we provide:

* Detailed description of the assignment
* Grading rubric
* Code template to serve as a starting point for students
* Automated grader
* Instructions for students to use the template and the grader
* Instructions for the course staff to setup the grader (if required)

Currently, both C and C++ are supported.

# Motivation
While similar programming assignments are used in many computer networking classes, we are not aware of any similar project including standardized assignments, test cases, and an automated tester/grader for a networking class, although such projects are quite common in other CS courses, in particular in OS (e.g., Pintos, Nachos). Our experience with CSE 489/589 has shown that the use of automated grading reduces the grading load from instructors and TAs and offers a better learning experience for students. Since students know their grade at the time of submission, instructors and TAs can utilize office hours much more efficiently, helping students with their assignments instead of dealing with complaints about grades, which are unavoidable when manual grading is involved. In addition, the grader prevents students from losing points for failing to follow certain specifications (e.g., naming conventions) and allows them instead to focus their debugging efforts on the networking components of each assignment.â€‹

The assignments are designed in a way that they are usable by similar courses **outside UB**'s CSE department, with _little to no changes_. Our instructions, in fact, provide usage/setup guides for both inside and outside UB scenarios.

# Programming Assignments

## Use
The assignments are designed in such a way that course instructors can use them by simply distributing to the students the link to a single document: **assignment handout** for a given PA, which contains the full description of the assignment problem, grading rubric, download links to the template and automated grader, and the link to the instructions for using the template and the automated grader. The document contains all the information required for the students to be able to complete the assignment (and even for the course staff to be able to grade student submissions). However, in certain cases, there is a one-time infrastructure setup required before the automated grader can work.

The _Details_ section below contains the link to web-page containing details/resources for each of the three PAs. The _assignment handout_ for each of the PAs can be accessed through the link labeled: **Description** on the PA's web-page. Although the page includes additional resources for each assignment, the _assignment handout_ is the **only** link/document that needs to be provided out to the students by the instructor. For quick reference, the links to the _assignment handout_ are provided here:

* [PA1 assignment handout](https://goo.gl/bqf2E1){:target="_blank"}
* [PA2 assignment handout](https://goo.gl/KzTh0J){:target="_blank"}
* [PA3 assignment handout](https://goo.gl/HYHcyQ){:target="_blank"}

The three assignments are completely independent of each other and the instructor might choose to use any subset of them. However, note that students may find it difficult to attempt PA3 without doing PA1 first.

## Setup (for Instructors/Course staff)
Wherever required, we mention the link to setup instructions, labeled as: **Instructions: Automated grader setup (Course staff)** under each PA's web-page accessed through the links mentioned below in the _Details_ section. The instructions list the infrastructure (servers, networking etc.) required for each PA and a guide to setup any components needed by the automated grader to function.

The setup/usage instructions, wherever needed, list separately the steps required by instructors at UB and for instructors/course staff outside UB. Although the PAs are generic in nature and not tied to UB specifically, UB-specific instructions take into account the specific infrastructure made available by UB's CSE-IT team to reduce the setup workload for UB course instructors/staff.

# Contact Us
We would love hear any feedback/comments regarding any aspect of the PAs. For bugs, feature requests etc. in the automated grader use the github repository linked under **Automated Grader (Source)** on each PA's web-page. Specifically, if you are trying to setup the PAs for a course outside UB, feel free to contact us with any questions regarding setup or any changes that you might like to make to adapt the PAs for your specific needs.
