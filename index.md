# Introduction
This is a set of _three_ **networking programming assignments** (PAs), along with an automated tester/grader, available to both students and instructors. The assignments have been used in CSE 489/589, a joint senior undergraduate/introductory graduate class, in the [CSE department](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html){:target="_blank"} at the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/){:target="_blank"}. For each PA, we provide:

* Detailed description of the assignment
* Grading rubric
* Code template to serve as a starting point for students
* Automated grader
* Instructions for students to use the template and the grader
* Instructions for the course staff to setup the grader

Currently, both C and C++ are supported.

# Motivation
While similar programming assignments are used in many computer networking classes, we are not aware of any similar project including standardized assignments, test cases, and an automated tester/grader for a networking class, although such projects are quite common in other CS courses, in particular in OS (e.g., Pintos, Nachos). Our experience with CSE 489/589 has shown that the use of automated grading reduces the grading load from instructors and TAs and offers a better learning experience for students. Since students know their grade at the time of submission, instructors and TAs can utilize office hours much more efficiently, helping students with their assignments instead of dealing with complaints about grades, which are unavoidable when manual grading is involved. In addition, the grader prevents students from losing points for failing to follow certain specifications (e.g., naming conventions) and allows them instead to focus their debugging efforts on the networking components of each assignment.â€‹
