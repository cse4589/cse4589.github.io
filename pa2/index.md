# Programming Assignment 2 (PA2)
## Overview
PA2 asks students to implement three **reliable data transport protocols**: _Alternating-Bit (ABT)_, _Go-Back-N (GBN)_, and _Selective-Repeat (SR)_, in a simple _simulator_ initially developed by Kurose-Ross, and compare their performance under different settings. In addition to understanding reliable protocols in depth, students obtain a basic understanding of how a discrete event simulator works and the differences between a simulator and a real system.

## Suggested workload/time
3-4 weeks

## Quick Checklist: Instructors/Course Staff
In order for students to be able to complete PA2, they need to be provided with:

1. Link to the assignment handout
3. Assignment of a grading host/machine to each student (Optional; Required only if repeatability of exact simulation results is needed)
