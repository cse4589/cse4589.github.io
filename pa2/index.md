# Programming Assignment 2 (PA2)
## Overview
PA2 asks students to implement three **reliable data transport protocols**: _Alternating-Bit (ABT)_, _Go-Back-N (GBN)_, and _Selective-Repeat (SR)_, in a simple _simulator_ initially developed by Kurose-Ross, and compare their performance under different settings. In addition to understanding reliable protocols in depth, students obtain a basic understanding of how a discrete event simulator works and the differences between a simulator and a real system.
