# Programming Assignment 1 (PA1)
## Overview
PA1 introduces students to **TCP socket programming**, asking them to develop the client and server components of a _text chat application_, consisting of one chat server (handling client registration, relaying messages, maintaining statistics, etc.) and multiple chat clients. As a bonus, students can implement file transfers between clients over P2P connections.
